# SEMS-STrategy

Problem Statement - Why Most Investors Underperform The Common Pitfalls:-

Decisions are based on emotions, not on historical data
No logic for timing entry or exit (ignoring seasonality)
Risk is spread unevenly across stocks
Buy-and-hold approach ignores short-term market behavior
Result:-

Low returns
High drawdowns
Unbalanced portfolios
Bottom Line: Even good stocks can give bad results if timing and risk aren't managed.

Project Objective - SEMS Strategy

SEMS: Seasonal Edge Macro Strategy

Goal: Answer one key question - "When are stocks most likely to perform well - statistically?"

Core Ideas:-

Analyze 15+ years of monthly return patterns
Identify high-performing months per stock
Only invest during those strong months
Use daily-level stop-loss and take-profit to guard against shocks
Distribute capital based on Sharpe-optimal weighting
Analogy: Act like a farmer: Only sow seeds (capital) during fertile seasons (months).
Use professional hedging strategies on underperforming stocks to manage downside risk
How the SEMS Model Works

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Monthly Return Analysis: Analyze 15 years of historical data by calculating weighted average monthly returns to identify statistically strong months.

Signal Generation: Generate entry signals by selecting only those months with consistently strong performance.

Capital Protection: Apply stop-loss (SL) to limit downside risk and take-profit (TP) to secure gains.

Portfolio Optimization: Allocate capital using weights optimized for the highest Sharpe Ratio.

5.Backtesting: Evaluate performance across 50 major U.S. stocks and benchmark against SPY.

Project Results & Insights:

Backtest Results vs SPY:-

Cumulative Returns: SEMS Higher
Volatility: SEMS Lower
Max Drawdown: SEMS Smaller
Win Ratio: SEMS Higher
Risk-Adjusted Return: SEMS Improved
Insights: SEMS delivers better returns with lower risk. Fewer trades, smarter entries. Capital preserved by protection rules.

Final Summary- What Makes SEMS Unique-

Rules-based investing, not emotion-based
Data-driven entry/exit using long-term seasonal trends
Daily-level SL/TP protection
Scientific capital allocation using risk models
Modular, flexible, scalable across markets
SEMS answers: "When should I be in the market, and when should I stay out?"

Improvements & Next Steps

Use standard deviation and volatility to detect market regimes and generate signals.
Apply machine learning to forecast monthly returns and identify regime shifts.
Incorporate portfolio-level Value at Risk (VaR) for dynamic risk management
Next: Move from backtesting to live trading deployment.
